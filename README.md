# Sonatable
Raspberry Pico W controller for our tabletop RPG table project. Controls sounds and LEDs

## Setup
1. Install [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) on your computer
2. Install [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/) on your Raspberry Pico
3. Open the files 'neopixel.py', 'debounce.py', 'color_utils.py' and 'patterns.py' in Thonny and save them to the Raspberry Pico
4. Open the 'main.py' file in Thonny and run it on the Raspberry Pico
5. If you want to auto-run the main.py file in RBP, you'll need to also save it as 'main.py' on the Pico via Thonny
6. Enjoy!
